=== Installation ===
1. Place this application into a directory where cgi-scripts are evaluated.
2. If you want to change some configuration, state it in the file »config.rb«
   (see config_sample.rb for help)
   to start with a default configuration.
3. The webserver needs the permission to write into the directory
4. You need .mo files in order to use localisations.
   You have 2 possibilities:
   a. Run this small script to fetch the files from the main server:
        cd $DUDLE_INSTALLATION_PATH
        for i in locale/??; do
          wget -O $i/dudle.mo https://dudle.inf.tu-dresden.de/locale/`basename $i`/dudle.mo
        done
   b. Build them on your own. This requires libgettext-ruby-util, potool, and make to be installed.
        sudo aptitude install libgettext-ruby-util potool make
        make
5. In order to let access control work correctly, the webserver needs
   auth_digest support. It therefore may help to type:
     sudo a2enmod auth_digest
6. Try to open http://$YOUR_SERVER/check.cgi to check if your config seems to work.
